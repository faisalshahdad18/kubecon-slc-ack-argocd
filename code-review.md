# Code Review - EKS Cluster Management with ArgoCD

## Repository Overview
This repository contains Helm charts and ArgoCD applications for managing multiple Amazon EKS clusters across different environments (dev, stage, prod) using GitOps practices.

## Key Components

### 1. Application Structure
- Uses an "App of Apps" pattern for ArgoCD
- Separate environment configurations for dev, staging, and production
- Helm-based deployment approach

### 2. Main Components
- `app-of-apps.yaml`: Root application that manages all other applications
- `apps/`: Contains ArgoCD application definitions for each environment
- `charts/sdlc-clusters/`: Helm chart containing the EKS cluster configurations
  - Environment-specific values files (values-dev.yaml, values-stage.yaml, values-prod.yaml)

## Configuration Analysis

### Environment Isolation
- Each environment (dev, stage, prod) has:
  - Dedicated namespace
  - Separate ArgoCD application definition
  - Environment-specific values file

### Infrastructure Configuration
- EKS cluster configurations are standardized across environments
- Disk size is set to 100GB across all environments

## Recommendations

1. **Security Considerations**
   - Consider implementing network policies
   - Review RBAC configurations
   - Implement resource quotas per namespace

2. **Resource Management**
   - Review and adjust resource requests/limits
   - Consider implementing horizontal pod autoscaling

3. **Best Practices**
   - Add more detailed documentation
   - Consider implementing environment-specific node groups
   - Add monitoring and logging configurations

## Conclusion
The codebase follows GitOps best practices and provides a solid foundation for managing multiple EKS clusters. The use of ArgoCD and Helm enables declarative infrastructure management and promotes consistency across environments.
